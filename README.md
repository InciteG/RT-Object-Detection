# Real Time Object Detection of VALORANT game.

## Goal: To optimize image processing and object detection to identify enemy units in real time and differentiate between ally units.

## Approach:
- Test Open CV match template on uniform enemy appearance (bots)
- Compare segmentation algorithms, thresholding, edge and contour detection techniques to process images
- Build real time screen capture function to capture game state
- Apply image processing to frames captured in real time and optimize performance
- Develop cascade classifier to identify enemy units in real time
