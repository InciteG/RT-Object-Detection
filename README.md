# Real Time Object Detection of VALORANT game.
 
 Sections:
 1. Build real time screen capture window and explore built in object detection techniques in OpenCV
 2. Develop real time cascade classifier to define target and develop reward system for reinforcement learning algorithm
 3. Train RL model to aim at target objects in different scenarios
